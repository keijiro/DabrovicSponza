**Dabrovic Sponza** is a Unity package containing the "Dabrovic Sponza"
architectural model, which the computer graphics community frequently used as a
test model.

Marko Dabrovic created the original model. Kenzie Lamar at Vicarious Visions
converted the 3DS file to OBJ and assigned texture coordinates to the ceilings.
Morgan McGuire hand-painted bump maps for most surfaces.

You can obtain the original model from the following page:
